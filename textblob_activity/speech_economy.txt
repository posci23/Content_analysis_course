Thank you. It is an honor to address you today about the issue that matters most to every family in this country: our economy. For too long, hardworking Americans have been told to wait — wait for growth, wait for opportunity, wait for their government to get out of the way. That waiting is over.

Let me share some facts. Unemployment stands at six point two percent. Wages have been stagnant for a decade while costs for housing, healthcare, and education have skyrocketed. Small businesses — the backbone of our economy — face a regulatory burden that stifles innovation and growth. Meanwhile, large corporations pay a lower effective tax rate than a teacher or a firefighter.

This is not the free market at work. This is a system that has been rigged by special interests and defended by politicians who benefit from the status quo. We need fundamental reform, not incremental tinkering.

Our plan is straightforward. First, we will cut taxes for working families and small businesses. A family earning less than seventy-five thousand dollars a year will see their tax burden reduced by twenty percent. Second, we will simplify regulations — not eliminate them, but make them smarter, faster, and less burdensome for entrepreneurs. Third, we will invest in infrastructure: roads, bridges, broadband, and the digital economy of the future.

Critics will say we cannot afford tax cuts and investment at the same time. But history proves them wrong. When President Kennedy cut taxes in nineteen sixty-three, the economy grew by five percent the following year. When we invested in the interstate highway system, it generated ten dollars in economic activity for every dollar spent. Smart fiscal policy pays for itself.

We must also confront the threat of unfair trade practices. Our trading partners have manipulated their currencies, subsidized their industries, and flooded our markets with cheap goods. This has cost us millions of manufacturing jobs. We will negotiate tougher trade deals that put American workers first, and we will enforce them with real consequences for violations.

But economic policy cannot succeed in isolation. A strong economy requires a healthy, educated workforce. That is why our plan includes expanded access to vocational training and community college, investments in mental health services, and affordable childcare so that every parent who wants to work can work.

The American economy has always been the engine of global prosperity. It has lifted billions out of poverty and created the highest standard of living in human history. But that engine needs maintenance. It needs investment. And most of all, it needs leaders who will fight for the people, not the powerful. That is the commitment I make to you today.
