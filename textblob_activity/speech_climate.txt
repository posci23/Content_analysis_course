My fellow citizens, we stand at a crossroads that will define our nation for generations to come. The science is clear: our planet is warming at an unprecedented rate, and the consequences of inaction are catastrophic. This is not a distant threat — it is happening now, in our communities, to our families.

Last year alone, we saw record-breaking wildfires, devastating hurricanes, and unprecedented flooding. Our farmers face longer droughts. Our coastal cities face rising seas. The data from our leading research institutions confirms what we can see with our own eyes: climate change is the defining challenge of our time.

But I want to be clear about something. Addressing climate change is not just an environmental issue — it is an economic opportunity. The clean energy sector already employs over three million Americans, and that number is growing every year. When we invest in renewable energy, we are investing in jobs. Good-paying jobs that cannot be outsourced.

We must also be honest about the transition ahead. Communities that have built their livelihoods around fossil fuels deserve our support and our respect. That is why our plan includes a twenty billion dollar investment in workforce retraining, community development, and economic diversification for coal and oil regions. No worker will be left behind.

Our competitors understand this. China is investing hundreds of billions in solar and wind technology. Europe has committed to carbon neutrality. If we fail to act, we will not only face environmental catastrophe — we will lose the economic race of the twenty-first century to nations that had the courage to lead.

Some say we cannot afford to act. I say we cannot afford not to. The cost of inaction — in lives lost, in economic damage, in national security threats — far exceeds the cost of investment. Every dollar we spend on clean energy today saves four dollars in climate damage tomorrow. That is not ideology. That is arithmetic.

Together, we can build a future that is cleaner, more prosperous, and more secure. A future where every community thrives, where every worker has opportunity, and where we leave our children a planet worth inheriting. The time for debate is over. The time for action is now.
