                    TEXTBLOB — A BEGINNER'S GUIDE
              For Political Science Content Analysis
================================================================================

WHAT IS TEXTBLOB?
-----------------
TextBlob is a free Python library that lets you analyze text automatically.
You give it a piece of text (a speech, a headline, an article), and it can
tell you things about that text — like whether it sounds positive or negative,
what the main topics are, or what types of words the author uses most.

Think of it as a research assistant that can read thousands of texts and
give you consistent measurements every single time.


WHY SHOULD I CARE?
------------------
In political science, we often do "content analysis" — systematically reading
texts to identify patterns. For example:
  - Is this speech mostly positive or negative?
  - Does this news outlet frame immigration differently than that one?
  - Does this politician talk more about "freedom" or "equality"?

Doing this by hand is slow and subjective. TextBlob automates parts of it,
giving you numbers you can compare and report in research.


WHAT CAN TEXTBLOB DO?
---------------------

1. SENTIMENT ANALYSIS
   What it does:  Gives every text two scores:
                  • Polarity:     -1.0 (very negative) to +1.0 (very positive)
                  • Subjectivity:  0.0 (very factual)  to  1.0 (very opinionated)

   Example:
     "The economy is growing and jobs are plentiful."
      → Polarity: +0.20 (slightly positive)
      → Subjectivity: 0.40 (somewhat factual)

     "The government's reckless policies destroyed our economy."
      → Polarity: -0.50 (negative)
      → Subjectivity: 0.75 (opinionated)

   Use it for:  Comparing tone across speeches, parties, or media outlets.


2. NOUN PHRASE EXTRACTION
   What it does:  Pulls out the key "things" a text talks about —
                  multi-word phrases like "climate change", "tax reform",
                  or "national security."

   Example:
     "The president's new climate plan will create clean energy jobs."
      → Noun phrases: ["president", "new climate plan", "clean energy jobs"]

   Use it for:  Quickly identifying what topics a text focuses on.


3. PART-OF-SPEECH TAGGING
   What it does:  Labels every word as a noun, verb, adjective, etc.

   Example:
     "We must fight for freedom."
      → We (pronoun), must (verb), fight (verb), for (preposition),
         freedom (noun)

   Use it for:  Analyzing rhetorical style. Does a speaker use lots of
                action verbs ("fight", "build", "create") or lots of
                adjectives ("dangerous", "radical", "historic")?


4. WORD AND SENTENCE TOKENIZATION
   What it does:  Splits text into individual words or sentences cleanly.

   Use it for:  Preparing text for deeper analysis. Breaking a speech
                into sentences so you can analyze each one separately.


5. N-GRAMS (WORD COMBINATIONS)
   What it does:  Finds common 2-word or 3-word combinations.

   Example:
     In a speech, the most common bigrams might be:
       "clean energy" (5 times), "working families" (4 times)

   Use it for:  Finding a speaker's talking points and repeated phrases.


6. WORD FREQUENCY / WORD COUNTS
   What it does:  Counts how many times each word appears.

   Use it for:  Basic content analysis — what words dominate a text?


HOW TO INSTALL TEXTBLOB
-----------------------
You only need to do this once. Open the terminal in Google Antigravity
(Ctrl + `) and type these two commands:

   pip install textblob
   python -m textblob.download_corpora

The first command installs the library. The second downloads language data
it needs (word lists, dictionaries, etc). This may take a minute.


HOW TO USE TEXTBLOB — THE BASICS
---------------------------------
Open a new Python file in Google Antigravity (or type "python" in the terminal).
Here is the simplest possible example:

   from textblob import TextBlob

   text = TextBlob("The president gave an excellent speech today.")

   print(text.sentiment)            # Shows polarity and subjectivity
   print(text.noun_phrases)         # Shows key noun phrases
   print(text.words)                # Shows individual words
   print(text.sentences)            # Shows sentences
   print(text.tags)                 # Shows part-of-speech tags

That's it. Five lines, and you already have five different analyses.


HOW TO ANALYZE A FILE
---------------------
To read a text file (like a speech) and analyze it:

   from textblob import TextBlob

   with open("my_speech.txt", "r") as f:
       text = TextBlob(f.read())

   print("Sentiment:", text.sentiment)
   print("Noun phrases:", text.noun_phrases)


WHAT DO THE PART-OF-SPEECH TAGS MEAN?
--------------------------------------
TextBlob uses standard abbreviations:

   NN  = noun (singular)         "economy", "freedom"
   NNS = noun (plural)           "taxes", "workers"
   NNP = proper noun             "America", "Congress"
   VB  = verb (base form)        "fight", "invest"
   VBD = verb (past tense)       "fought", "invested"
   VBG = verb (-ing form)        "fighting", "investing"
   JJ  = adjective               "strong", "dangerous"
   RB  = adverb                  "very", "quickly"
   PRP = pronoun                 "we", "they", "our"


LIMITATIONS — WHAT TEXTBLOB CANNOT DO
--------------------------------------
Be aware of these before using TextBlob in research:

1. IT WAS TRAINED ON PRODUCT REVIEWS, NOT POLITICAL TEXT
   The word "radical" might be negative in a review but neutral in
   political science. The sentiment scores are approximate, not perfect.

2. IT STRUGGLES WITH SARCASM AND NEGATION
   "This is not a bad policy" should be slightly positive, but TextBlob
   may score it negatively because it sees the word "bad."

3. IT GIVES YOU NUMBERS, NOT UNDERSTANDING
   A speech scored +0.15 is "slightly positive" — but TextBlob cannot
   tell you WHY it's positive or what argument the speaker is making.

4. IT WORKS BEST IN ENGLISH
   TextBlob supports other languages for some features, but its sentiment
   analysis is English-focused.

Despite these limitations, TextBlob is a powerful starting point for
automated content analysis, especially when combined with human judgment.


WHAT IS "CONTENT ANALYSIS"? (QUICK REFRESHER)
-----------------------------------------------
Content analysis is a research method where you systematically categorize
text to identify patterns. There are three main approaches:

   MANUAL         A human reads each text and assigns codes from a codebook.
                  Most accurate, but slow and expensive.

   DICTIONARY     A computer counts specific keywords from a predefined list.
                  Fast and 100% reproducible, but misses context.
                  (This is what our dictionary_analysis.py does.)

   NLP/AI         A computer uses language models to "understand" text.
                  TextBlob sits here. Fast, context-aware, but imperfect.

In real research, you often COMBINE methods — for example, using TextBlob
for an initial pass on 10,000 articles, then manually coding a random
sample of 200 to check accuracy. This is called VALIDATION.
